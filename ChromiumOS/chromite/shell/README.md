# Shell Migration Staging Area

This directory contains scripts which were historically located in `src/scripts`
and are currently being migrated to Python.  Previous history of these scripts
can be found at:

In general, we don't want to grow the shell functionality too much, and would
prefer that new things be handled in Python when possible.
